# How it works
Users can create an account/login via Firebase authentication and upload images from their phone gallery of skin irregularities.
The TensorFlow Lite model will assess the probability of a benign/malignant condition and give the result to the user.
The image and prediction can be saved in Firebase cloud storage upon the user's request.
